                <h2>WHY TUNNELS ?</h2>
                <p>
                    To solve the problem of soul-destroying traffic, roads must go 3D, which means either flying cars or tunnels are needed. Unlike flying cars, tunnels are weatherproof, out of sight, and won't fall on your head.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Tunnels minimize usage of valuable surface land and do not conflict with existing transportation systems. A large network of tunnels can alleviate congestion in any city; no matter how large a city grows, more levels of tunnels can be added.

                <h2>Benefits of Tunnel</h2>
                <p>
                <span>Unlimited Capacity:</span> there is no practical limit to how many layers of tunnels can be built, so any current or future capacity outcome can be achieved. This flexibility contrasts with a surface system where adding a lane to the road is often difficult
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span>Minimal Use of Land:</span> tunnels minimize the use of valuable surface land. Tunnels also do not conflict with currently operating transportation systems, such as roads and sidewalks
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span>Weatherproof Operation:</span> rain, snow, wind, and surface temperatures do not affect system operation
                </p>
                <p>
                   <span> Future Expansion:</span> it is much simpler to extend a tunnel-based system than a surface-based system
                </p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <!-- constuction  -->
        <div class="loop construction-bg" >
            <div class="loop-info" data-aos="fade-up">
                <h2> CONSTRUCTION</h2>
                <p>
                    <span>Utilities:</span> with a typical minimum depth of 30 feet, our tunnels are well beneath most utilities, which are typically less than 10 feet below the surface. In circumstances where a utility is located deeper, the tunnel depth is increased accordingly
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span>No disruptive surface vibration or noise during tunneling:</span> once a tunnel boring machine is below approximately two tunnel diameters, or 28 feet, the tunneling process is almost impossible to detect, especially in soft soil. The tunnel operation is inaudible, and there is typically more surface vibration felt from a pedestrian walking nearby than from the TBM operating 30+ feet below
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span>Managing excavated dirt:</span> in typical tunneling projects, excavated dirt is shipped offsite to disposal locations. This process is costly, time-consuming, noisy, and environmentally-unsustainable. We recycle a portion of the muck into useful bricks and pavers to be used to build anything from affordable housing to patios. This is not a new concept, as buildings have been constructed from earth for thousands of years including, according to recent evidence, the Pyramids. These earth blocks can potentially be used as a portion of the tunnel lining itself, which is typically built from concrete. Since concrete production accounts for 4.5% of the worldâ€™s greenhouse gas emissions, earth blocks would reduce both environmental impact and tunneling costs
